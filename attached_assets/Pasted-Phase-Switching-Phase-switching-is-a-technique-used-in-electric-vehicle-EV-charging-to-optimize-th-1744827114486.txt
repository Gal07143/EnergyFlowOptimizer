Phase Switching
Phase switching is a technique used in electric vehicle (EV) charging to optimize the different phases involved in charging an electric car at home via a wallbox.

‍

How does it work?
Phase switching in EV smart charging refers to the process of alternating between different phases of the electrical current supplied to the charger. Electrical grids typically run on three phases – each delivering power via a specific conductor at different times. By switching between these phases during the charging process, the system can optimize power usage, balance load demands, and reduce overall charging times. This flexibility ensures that energy distribution remains efficient, particularly when multiple EVs are charging simultaneously, without overwhelming the electrical infrastructure.

Before diving into the different types of phase switching in EV charging, it’s important to understand the basics of 1-phase and 3-phase charging.

1-Phase (single-phase) charging: This method uses a single phase of electrical power through a single conductor, providing lower charging power of up to 7.4 kilowatts (kW) and around 110 to 240 volts. This is sufficient for everyday home use but results in slower charging times. Most hybrid cars and small EVs can only use single-phase charging.

3-Phase (three-phase) charging: This method uses three phases of electrical power simultaneously through three conductors, delivering up to 22 kW and around 400 volts. This increased power capacity significantly reduces charging times compared to single-phase systems. Understanding the difference between 1-phase and 3-phase charging is key to optimizing EV charging. While 3-phase offers faster charging, switching between phases is crucial for balancing grid loads, adapting to available infrastructure, and enhancing energy efficiency. This flexibility ensures smoother, cost-effective charging and prevents overloading the system, combining the best of both methods.

Why phase switching is important
Three-phase charging has a power capacity, delivering more power to the EV to charge it more quickly. While this is often desirable, it can lead to large amounts of power being drawn in short amounts of time, leading to either grid overloads or high fees. As such, lowering the amount of power and switching the 1-phase charging at opportune times can lead to lower charging costs and ensure the most efficient use of energy.

Technical requirements of phase switching
Phase switching requires a wallbox charger that is capable of switching phases. The charger must also be connected to a compatible electrical control panel, which manages the distribution and regulation of electricity throughout the charging process.  

Car, cable and connection requirements
Electric vehicle: The electric vehicle must be able to use three-phase charging. As mentioned above, some models, such as a Mazda MX-30 can only charge with 1-phase power.

Electrical cable: Similarly, cables must be capable of transmitting 3-phase power. Type 1 cables support only 1-phase charging, while Type 2 cables support both 1-phase and 3-phase charging. To ensure that the Type 2 cable supports 3-phase charging, it is important to check the plug – if all seven holes have the same filling, it should support 3-phase, if the lower two holes are empty, it likely only supports 1-phase.


Household connection: In Europe, approximately 90% of homes in countries like Germany and the Netherlands are equipped with three-phase power, making this method ideal for fast EV charging in these areas​. However, older homes or rural regions may still rely on 1-phase power, requiring upgrades for compatibility. This can be checked in the electricity meter – generally if the meter has a 220 / 230V connection, it is only capable of single-phase charging. Higher numbers, such as 380V or 400V support three phases.

Wallbox charger requirements
Three-phase charger: Just like cars can only support single-phase charging, so too can wallboxes. It is therefore vital to have an EV, charger and connection that is capable of three-phase charging.

Phase switching support: The wallbox charger must be equipped with phase switching capability, allowing it to dynamically switch between 1-phase and 3-phase charging modes.

Power management: The charger should intelligently manage the power distribution, optimizing the charging process based on available power and household energy consumption.

Electrical control panel compatibility
Phase switching compatibility: The electrical panel must be compatible with phase switching, supporting both 1-phase and 3-phase power inputs.

Load balancing: The panel should support load balancing to prevent overloading the grid during high-demand periods, particularly when switching between phases.
