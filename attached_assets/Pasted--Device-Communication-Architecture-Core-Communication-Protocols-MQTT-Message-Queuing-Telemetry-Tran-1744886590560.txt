 Device Communication Architecture
Core Communication Protocols
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)

Primary protocol for real-time bidirectional communication
Lightweight pub/sub model ideal for IoT devices with limited bandwidth
Support for QoS levels (0, 1, 2) for delivery guarantees
TLS/SSL encryption for secure communication
HTTP/REST API

Secondary protocol for configuration, firmware updates, and historical data retrieval
Webhook endpoints for event notifications
Used for devices without MQTT support
JSON/XML payload format for consistent data exchange
WebSocket

For real-time UI updates and dashboard visualization
Direct device communication for low-latency requirements
Protocol Adapters for Specialized Devices
Modbus (TCP/RTU)

For industrial equipment, inverters, meters
Polling intervals configurable per device type
Protocol conversion to MQTT for unified data handling
OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol)

For EV chargers (versions 1.6, 2.0)
Transaction management and charging profiles
Central System implementation for managing charging networks
EEBus

For heat pumps and home appliances
Energy management for flexible consumption/production
SunSpec

For solar inverters and PV monitoring
Standardized data model for solar energy systems
