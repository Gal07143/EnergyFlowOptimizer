E-Mobility Service Provider
An e-Mobility Service Provider (eMSP) is a company that facilitates electric vehicle (EV) charging roaming services, providing EV drivers with seamless access to various charging networks without requiring separate memberships. The eMSP handles services like charging passes,access to charging stations, station location apps, network management, billing and customer support.

Why is eMSP important?
e-Mobility service providers are crucial for the seamless functioning of electric vehicle (EV) charging ecosystems. They provide a unified platform, enabling EV drivers to access multiple charging networks without the complexity of individual memberships. eMSPs streamline services such as billing, customer support and network management, fostering the growth and convenience of e-mobility.

Think of an eMSP as the "aggregator platform” for electric vehicle charging. Just as these platforms enable communication across multiple retailers, so too does an eMSP facilitate smooth interaction between EV drivers and various charging networks, eliminating the need for separate "merchants" or memberships at each station. This simplifies the charging experience, making it akin to speaking a common language in a diverse and interconnected charging landscape.

e-Mobility service provider (eMSP) vs charge point operator (CPO)

‍Charge Point Operators (CPOs) form the backbone of the electric vehicle (EV) charging industry, undertaking the construction, installation and maintenance of charging infrastructure. They navigate backend technologies to ensure smooth operations and may own or extend services to third-party owners.

In contrast, e-mobility service providers (eMSPs) play a key role in customer interactions, engaging directly with EV drivers. While CPOs focus on the physical and technological aspects of charging infrastructure, eMSPs do not typically own the chargers, but rather collaborate with charge point owners to deliver a comprehensive and user-friendly charging experience.

The distinction between CPOs and eMSPs lies in their primary functions within the EV charging ecosystem. CPOs serve as the architects of charging infrastructure, managing construction and backend technologies. They may own or offer services to third parties, emphasizing the physical and technological dimensions. 

On the other hand, eMSPs prioritize the end user experience, directly engaging with EV drivers through tools like access cards and mobile apps. While not owning the physical infrastructure, eMSPs collaborate with CPOs to provide comprehensive charging solutions, creating a symbiotic relationship between the infrastructure backbone and customer-facing services.
