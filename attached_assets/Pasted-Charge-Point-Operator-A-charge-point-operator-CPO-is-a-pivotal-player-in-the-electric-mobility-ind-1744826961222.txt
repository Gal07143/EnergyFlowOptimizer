What’s the difference between CPO, eMSP and charge point owners? 
In the dynamic landscape of e-mobility, three key entities play distinct yet interconnected roles: charge point operators (CPOs), e-mobility service providers (eMSPs) and charge point owners. But they are distinct from each other. 

CPOs serve as the backbone of the industry, undertaking the construction, installation and maintenance of electric vehicle charging infrastructure, as mentioned above. Beyond the physical aspects, they navigate backend technologies, ensuring seamless charging operations and often collaborating with diverse EV charging station vendors. It has to be noted that CPOs may either own and operate their own charging stations or extend their services to third-party owners, reflecting the flexibility and diversity within this sector. 

On the other hand, e-Mobility services providers (eMSPs) emerge as key customer-facing players. These entities directly engage with EV drivers, offering a suite of services that enhance the end user experience. eMSPs manage customer interactions through tools such as access cards, mobile apps and responsive customer support. Critically, while eMSPs do not typically own the physical charging infrastructure, they forge collaborations with CPOs and charge point owners to deliver comprehensive and user-friendly charging solutions. 

Meanwhile, charge point owners represent the entities or individuals directly responsible for the ownership of physical charging stations. Whether owned by private businesses, government entities, or individuals, charge point owners may choose to operate the charging stations themselves or enlist the services of CPOs for installation, maintenance and backend operations. 

This triad of CPOs, eMSPs and charge point owners collectively shapes the evolving electric mobility landscape, with each entity contributing its unique expertise to foster an efficient and user-centric charging infrastructure.
